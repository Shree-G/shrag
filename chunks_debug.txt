# shrag: Personal RAG Chatbot API

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9-blue.svg)
![LangChain](https://img.shields.io/badge/LangChain-v0.2-green)
![FastAPI](https://img.shields.io/badge/FastAPI-Production-teal)
![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-Containerized-blue)

**shrag** (Shree's RAG) is a production-grade, full-stack Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) API designed to answer questions about my professional background, projects, and skills. Unlike simple tutorial bots, this project focuses on **engineering rigor**: it features a decoupled architecture, a formal evaluation pipeline, semantic chunking strategies, and containerized deployment. ## 🚀 Key Features

* **Production Architecture:** Built as a standalone **FastAPI** service, decoupled from the frontend to allow for independent scaling and flexible UI integration (currently serving an `assistant-ui` frontend). * **Advanced Ingestion Pipeline:** Uses **Semantic Chunking** (via `langchain-experimental`) rather than naive character splitting to ensure retrieved context maintains semantic integrity. * **Conversational Memory:** Implements a history-aware retrieval chain that re-phrases follow-up questions to maintain context across multi-turn conversations. * **Rigorous Evaluation:** The pipeline is not just "eye-balled." It is formally evaluated using **DeepEval** and **LangSmith** against a synthetic "Golden Dataset" to measure Faithfulness, Answer Relevancy, and Contextual Precision.

--------------------
* **Containerized Deployment:** Fully Dockerized and deployed via **Render**, ensuring a consistent environment from development to production. ## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Core AI & RAG
* **Orchestration:** LangChain (Python)
* **LLM Inference:** [Groq](https://groq.com/) (Llama 3.3 70B & Llama 3.1 8B) for sub-second latency. * **Vector Database:** ChromaDB (Persistent local storage). * **Embeddings:** HuggingFace (`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`). * **Ingestion:** Custom Python scripts using `SemanticChunker`. ### Backend Engineering
* **Framework:** FastAPI (Asynchronous Python web server). * **Validation:** Pydantic (Strict data contracts for Requests/Responses). * **Server:** Uvicorn. ### DevOps & Evaluation
* **Containerization:** Docker (Multi-stage builds). * **Hosting:** Render (Web Service). * **Observability:** LangSmith (Tracing and debugging). * **Evaluation Metrics:** DeepEval (Unit testing for RAG performance). ## 🧠 Architecture Overview

### 1. The Data Pipeline (`/scripts/ingest.py`)
The system ingests data from multiple sources:
* **PDF Resume:** Parsed and chunked. * **GitHub Repositories:** Dynamically fetches `README.md` files from my public GitHub profile using the GitHub API. * **Personal Data:** Ingests structured CSV data regarding coursework and skills. **Chunking Strategy:** I moved away from naive `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to **Semantic Chunking**. This calculates the cosine similarity between sentences and only "breaks" a chunk when the topic shifts, resulting in higher quality context for the LLM. ### 2. The RAG Chain (`/core/chain.py`)
The application uses a **Conversational Retrieval Chain** pattern:
1. **Rephrase:** A lightweight LLM (Llama 3 8B) takes the user's query and chat history to generate a standalone search query. 2. **Retrieve:** This query searches the ChromaDB vector store for the top `k` (tuned to k=3) semantically relevant chunks. 3. **Generate:** The retrieved context and the original question are passed to the synthesis LLM (Llama 3 70B or 8B) to generate the final response. ### 3. The API Layer (`/app/api.py`)
The chain is exposed via a RESTful `/chat` endpoint. It handles:
* **Session Management:** Tracking conversation history via `session_id`. * **CORS:** allowing secure requests from the Next.js frontend. * **Source Citation:** Returning metadata about which files (e.g., `Resume.pdf`, `shrocial_media.git`) were used to generate the answer. ## 🧪 Evaluation & Testing

To ensure reliability, I implemented an automated evaluation pipeline (`evaluate.py`) that integrates **DeepEval** with **LangSmith**. * **Golden Dataset:** A curated set of 40+ QA pairs covering factual recall, summarization, and negative constraints (questions the bot *shouldn't* answer). * **Metrics Tracked:**
    * **Faithfulness:** Does the answer come *only* from the context? (Prevents hallucinations). * **Answer Relevancy:** Did the bot actually answer the user's question? * **Contextual Precision:** Did the retriever find the right document?
